- Prompt engineering (zero/few-shot, system prompts, CoT)  
- Parameters: temperature, max tokens, stop sequences  
- **Math/Stats:** Vectors, cosine similarity  

---

### **Week 2 â€“ Bedrock Embeddings & Knowledge Bases**
**Goal:** Store and query embeddings for contextual AI.  
- Titan embeddings API  
- Bedrock Knowledge Bases basics  
- Embedding search (FAISS)  
- Vector DBs: Pinecone, OpenSearch Vector Engine  
- **Math:** Dot product, norms, distance metrics  

---

### **Week 3 â€“ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
**Goal:** Build your first RAG pipeline.  
- LangChain document loaders (PDF, web, CSV)  
- Chunking & metadata tagging  
- Embedding storage & retrieval  
- Context injection into prompts  
- Hallucination detection via retrieval evals  

---

### **Week 4 â€“ Agents & Tools**
**Goal:** Create an LLM agent that uses tools.  
- LangChain agents (react, zero-shot-react, tool-calling)  
- Built-in tools vs custom tools  
- Memory types (ConversationBuffer, SummaryMemory)  
- AWS S3 tool integration  
- **Math:** Probability basics & confidence scoring  

---

### **Week 5 â€“ LangGraph & Multi-Agent Orchestration**
**Goal:** Build stateful workflows for agents.  
- LangGraph basics (nodes, edges, conditional routing)  
- Loops, retries, state persistence  
- Multi-agent orchestration  
- Combining RAG + tools in LangGraph  
- AWS Bedrock Agents  

---

### **Week 6 â€“ MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
**Goal:** Standardize tool integration for agents.  
- MCP concepts & benefits  
- Running an MCP server locally  
- Exposing APIs/databases as MCP tools  
- Agent consuming MCP tools  
- **ML Concepts:** Overview of transformers & embeddings  

---

### **Week 7 â€“ Deployment & Scaling**
**Goal:** Deploy and scale in production.  
- AWS Lambda + API Gateway deployment  
- SAM CLI / CDK for IaC  
- Provisioned concurrency & cold start optimization  
- Step Functions orchestration  
- Monitoring: LangSmith, CloudWatch  
- Security: Secrets Manager, IAM least privilege  

---

### **Week 8 â€“ Capstone & Consulting Prep**
**Goal:** Build portfolio projects & prepare for client work.  
- **Capstone:** Multi-agent AWS Bedrock app with RAG + LangGraph + MCP, deployed serverlessly  
- Cost modeling for GenAI workloads  
- Security & compliance checklist (PII, GDPR, HIPAA)  
- Create demo deck & record walkthrough  
- Draft consulting proposal & SoW template
